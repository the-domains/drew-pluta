My background is an intersection of music, graphic art and technology which infuses my work with an original edge that is both visually arresting and versatile.

I began my career as a professional musician, and played an active role in the Goth/Industrial music  scenes in Chicago and Los Angeles. I was the guitarist for the band "Arcanta," (Projekt Records) toured internationally and worked for many years as an ASCAP recording artist and producer when I moved to Los Angeles. During this time, I began developing my work in photography and design, and gradually established my style as it became my professional focus.

As a commercial photographer, I have worked on a broad spectrum of projects. I have shot editorial and look-book campaigns, including Gunnar Deatherage who featured my work on Project Runway in 2012\. My editorial and publication work includes credits for Black and Grey, Variety, L.A Weekly, and I am currently an Art Director and Contributing Editor for the arts and culture magazine, Black & Grey. I shoot commercial fashion, portraits, and landscapes and continue to work on my own fine art projects.
